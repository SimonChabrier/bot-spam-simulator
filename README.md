# Bot Attack Simulator

This is a simple bot attack simulator that simulates a botnet attack on a target server. The simulator allows you to specify the number of bots, the attack duration, and the target server's IP address. The simulator will then generate random requests to the target server for the specified duration.

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

```bash
npm run simulate
